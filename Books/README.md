Design Choices for the Book Haven Landing Page
Color Scheme
Background Color: The background color for the entire page is set to a light grey (#f0f0f0). This choice provides a neutral and soft backdrop, ensuring that the content stands out without causing eye strain.
Navbar and Footer: Both the navbar and footer use dark colors (#333 and #e72881 for text) to create a strong visual contrast with the light background, making the navigation elements easily noticeable and accessible.
Typography
Font Choices: The body text uses a clean and modern sans-serif font (Arial), ensuring readability across various devices. For the overlay text on the banner, a fancy cursive font ('Great Vibes') is used to add a touch of elegance and appeal.
Logo: The logo text ("Book Haven") is made significantly larger (36px) than other text elements to ensure it stands out as a key branding element.
Layout and Responsiveness
Navbar: The navbar is designed to be transparent to blend seamlessly with the background. It includes a toggler button that collapses the navigation links into a dropdown menu on smaller screens, ensuring a mobile-friendly design.
Banner: The banner image is set to cover the full viewport width and height, with object-fit: cover ensuring it scales appropriately without distortion. This creates a visually appealing full-screen welcome section.
Overlay Text: Positioned at the center of the banner with a semi-transparent background, the overlay text is easily readable against the banner image. The use of fancy font for the overlay text adds sophistication.
Content Alignment: The short sentence in the navbar is aligned to the right using ms-auto, ensuring it stays in place on larger screens but hides on smaller screens for a cleaner layout.
Product Section
Card Design: Each product is displayed in a card with an image, title, description, and a "Shop Now" button. The cards are styled to have a clean look with no border and a subtle hover effect that slightly lifts the card to indicate interactivity.
Responsive Grid: The product cards are arranged using Bootstrapâ€™s grid system, ensuring they are displayed in a neat and responsive layout that adjusts according to the screen size.
Overall User Experience
Responsive Design: Media queries ensure the layout adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes, providing an optimal viewing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Interactivity: Hover effects on the product cards and a responsive navbar enhance the user experience by providing visual feedback and easy navigation.
Summary
The design choices made during the development of the Book Haven landing page focus on creating a visually appealing, user-friendly, and responsive online store. The use of a consistent color scheme, readable typography, and strategic layout ensures that users have an enjoyable and accessible experience while browsing the site.
